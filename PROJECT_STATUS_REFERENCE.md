- **Database:** PostgreSQL with 11 tables + views
- **Real-time:** Event-driven architecture with notifications

### **Database Schema (PostgreSQL):**
1. **users** - User accounts and authentication
2. **colonies** - Colony data and settings  
3. **ants** - Individual ant entities with lifecycle data
4. **colony_resources** - Resource storage and management
5. **buildings** - Colony structures and buildings
6. **map_tiles** - Territory and exploration data
7. **technologies** - Research tree and unlocks
8. **battles** - Combat system data
9. **game_events** - Event logging and history
10. **game_sessions** - Session management
11. **colony_structures** - Structure placement and status

## üéÆ **Implemented Features:**

### **‚úÖ Core Systems:**
- Colony creation with 5-step wizard
- Ant lifecycle system (egg ‚Üí larva ‚Üí pupa ‚Üí adult ‚Üí death)
- Queen mechanics and reproduction
- Resource management (food, wood, stone, water, minerals)
- Resource events and conversion mechanics
- Complete structure building system with 12+ structure types
- Construction management with worker assignment
- Structure placement UI with drag-and-drop functionality
- Construction confirmation dialog with resource cost breakdown
- Population management and statistics
- Real-time notifications and event system

### **‚úÖ User Interface:**
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile
- Colony dashboard with 7 tabs (Overview, Structures, Storage, Resources, Foraging, Population, Defenses)
- Resource monitoring with quality indicators
- Population dashboard with lifecycle visualization
- Advanced structure placement system with visual feedback
- Grid-based structure map with real-time construction progress
- Structure catalog with categorized building types
- Structure details panel with upgrade/repair/demolish options
- Notification system with 8 notification types
- Real-time updates and auto-refresh capabilities

### **‚úÖ Game Mechanics:**
- Time-based simulation with configurable tick rates
