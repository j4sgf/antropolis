# Task ID: 18
# Title: Achievement System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 17
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement the achievement system as described in section 5.7.
# Details:
1. Design achievement categories:
   - Colony growth (population milestones)
   - Resource collection (amount thresholds)
   - Battle achievements (victories, strategies)
   - Evolution achievements (tech tree completion)
   - Exploration achievements (map coverage)
2. Implement achievement triggers and checks
3. Create achievement notification system
4. Design achievement UI with completion status
5. Add achievement rewards (cosmetic upgrades)
6. Implement achievement progress tracking
7. Create achievement metadata (rarity, completion percentage)
8. Add social sharing for achievements (optional)

# Test Strategy:
Test achievement triggers under various conditions. Verify notifications appear appropriately. Test achievement UI displays correct completion status. Verify rewards are granted for completed achievements. Test progress tracking for incremental achievements.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Achievement Database Schema and API Endpoints [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement the database schema for achievements and create the necessary API endpoints for achievement management.
### Details:
Create a PostgreSQL schema for achievements with tables for: 1) achievement_definitions (id, category, title, description, icon_path, rarity, reward_type, reward_value), 2) player_achievements (player_id, achievement_id, progress, completed, completion_date, reward_claimed). Implement RESTful API endpoints in Node.js/Express for: GET /api/achievements (list all), GET /api/achievements/:id (details), GET /api/players/:id/achievements (player progress), POST /api/players/:id/achievements/:achievementId/claim (claim rewards).

## 2. Achievement Trigger System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the core achievement trigger system that monitors game events and updates achievement progress.
### Details:
Create an AchievementManager class that subscribes to game events using the Observer pattern. Implement event listeners for: colony growth events, resource collection events, battle outcomes, technology research completion, and map exploration updates. For each event type, add logic to check relevant achievements, calculate progress, and update the database. Include threshold checking to determine when achievements are completed. Implement a queue system for batching achievement updates to minimize database writes.

## 3. Achievement UI Components [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement the UI components for displaying achievements, progress, and rewards.
### Details:
Create React components for: 1) AchievementList - displays all achievements grouped by category with filter/sort options, 2) AchievementCard - shows individual achievement with icon, title, description, progress bar, and completion status, 3) AchievementDetails - expanded view with full details and claim reward button, 4) AchievementNotification - toast notification for newly unlocked achievements. Implement responsive design for all components. Use CSS animations for achievement completion effects. Create a dedicated Achievements page accessible from the main menu.

## 4. Achievement Notification and Reward System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the notification system for achievement completion and the reward distribution mechanism.
### Details:
Create a notification service that displays toast messages when achievements are completed. Implement a WebSocket connection to push real-time achievement updates to the client. Design the reward claiming flow: 1) Player clicks claim button on completed achievement, 2) Frontend sends request to claim endpoint, 3) Backend validates eligibility, 4) Reward is added to player inventory (cosmetic items, badges, profile decorations), 5) Achievement status is updated to claimed. Create visual feedback for reward claiming with animations and sound effects.

## 5. Achievement Analytics and Social Features [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement achievement statistics, rarity calculations, and social sharing functionality.
### Details:
Create a background job that calculates achievement statistics daily: completion percentage across all players, average time to complete, and rarity tiers (common, uncommon, rare, epic, legendary). Update the achievement UI to display these statistics. Implement social sharing buttons that generate shareable images with achievement details and player name/avatar. Add an achievement leaderboard showing top players by achievement count or points. Create an achievement feed in the community section showing recent unlocks by friends or global players.
