# Task ID: 4
# Title: Core Game Loop and Simulation Engine
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the core game loop and simulation engine that will drive the ant colony simulation.
# Details:
1. Implement a time-based simulation loop with configurable tick rate
2. Create event system for simulation events (ant birth, resource collection, attacks)
3. Develop state management for colony resources and population
4. Implement basic ant behavior logic:
   - Workers: resource collection and structure building
   - Soldiers: defense and attack
   - Scouts: exploration
5. Create resource consumption and production calculations
6. Implement colony growth mechanics based on resources
7. Design a system for pausing/resuming simulation
8. Optimize performance for handling large numbers of ants
9. Support multiple colonies running simultaneously

# Test Strategy:
Unit test individual simulation components. Measure performance with varying colony sizes. Test state consistency across simulation ticks. Verify resource calculations match expected outcomes. Test pause/resume functionality. Verify multi-colony support with independent state tracking.
