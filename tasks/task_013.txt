# Task ID: 13
# Title: Battle Simulation System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4, 12
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the battle system for conflicts between player and AI colonies as described in section 5.4 and ST-105.
# Details:
1. Design battle simulation algorithm:
   - Factor in ant stats (strength, defense, etc.)
   - Consider formation and positioning
   - Apply terrain bonuses/penalties
   - Calculate casualties and outcomes
2. Implement scheduled AI attacks on player colony
3. Create player-initiated raid mechanics on enemy colonies
4. Design battle resolution screen with outcome details
5. Implement resource rewards for successful battles
6. Create battle history logging
7. Add visual battle simulation (optional)
8. Implement retreat mechanics and consequences

# Test Strategy:
Test battle calculations with various colony compositions. Verify that stats, formation, and terrain correctly affect outcomes. Test scheduled AI attacks trigger appropriately. Verify resource rewards scale with battle difficulty. Test battle history logging. Verify retreat mechanics function correctly.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Battle Simulation Algorithm Core [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the core battle simulation algorithm that calculates battle outcomes based on ant stats, formations, and terrain factors.
### Details:
Create a new module `battleSimulator.js` in the backend that exports a function to simulate battles. Implement logic to: 1) Compare colony strengths based on ant types and quantities, 2) Apply modifiers for terrain types stored in the database, 3) Calculate casualties on both sides, 4) Determine victor based on remaining strength. The algorithm should be deterministic but include some controlled randomness for battle outcomes. Store battle parameters in a configuration object for easy balancing.

## 2. Develop AI Attack Scheduling System [done]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Implement a system for AI colonies to periodically attack the player's colony based on difficulty settings and game progression.
### Details:
Create an `aiAttackScheduler.js` module that runs on a timer to determine when AI attacks occur. Implement difficulty scaling based on player progression. Create database tables to track AI aggression levels and attack cooldowns. Add an endpoint `/api/battles/incoming` for the frontend to check for incoming attacks. Ensure the scheduler uses the battle simulation algorithm to pre-calculate potential outcomes and only launches winnable attacks (with some randomness based on difficulty).

- Added ai_attacks table - Track scheduled/ongoing attacks with status, forces, arrival times
- Added battle_history table - Store completed battle records with outcomes and forces
- Added performance indexes on target_id, status, timestamps

Testing:
- Created test-ai-attack-scheduler.js with 11 comprehensive test scenarios
- Achieved 100% success rate (11/11 tests passed) in 5.68 seconds
- Tests cover API health check, scheduler status/start/stop, incoming attacks, battle targets, simulation, execution, history, statistics, and retreat mechanism

## 3. Create Player-Initiated Raid System [done]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Implement the system allowing players to initiate attacks on AI colonies, including target selection, ant allocation, and battle execution.
### Details:
Create React components for raid planning (`RaidPlanner.jsx`, `ColonySelector.jsx`, `AntAllocation.jsx`). Implement backend endpoints at `/api/battles/targets` to list attackable colonies and `/api/battles/execute` to process player attacks. Create a database schema to track available targets and their strength. Implement a cooldown system to prevent spam attacks. Use the battle simulation algorithm to determine outcomes when a raid is executed.
