# Task ID: 3
# Title: Colony Creation and Customization UI
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the colony creation screen where players can name their colony and select starting attributes according to ST-101.
# Details:
1. Create a form component for colony creation with the following fields:
   - Colony name input
   - Attribute selection sliders for Strength, Speed, Intelligence, Defense
   - Colony type selection (Aggressive, Defensive, Balanced)
   - Color palette selection for visual customization
2. Implement form validation
3. Connect form submission to backend API
4. Design an appealing UI with naturalistic, earthy color palette
5. Add animations for transitions between creation steps
6. Implement responsive design for mobile compatibility

# Test Strategy:
Test form validation for required fields. Verify that attribute points have proper constraints. Test API integration for colony creation. Conduct usability testing to ensure the interface is intuitive. Test responsive design on various screen sizes.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Colony Creation Form Component Structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build the basic React component structure for the colony creation form with all required input fields and layout.
### Details:
Create a new React component called ColonyCreationForm.jsx in the src/components/colony directory. Implement a multi-step form with the following sections: 1) Colony name input with validation, 2) Attribute selection sliders for Strength, Speed, Intelligence, Defense with appropriate min/max values and visual feedback, 3) Colony type radio buttons (Aggressive, Defensive, Balanced) with descriptive tooltips, 4) Color palette selection with at least 8 color options. Use React hooks (useState) to manage form state and implement the basic navigation between form steps.

## 2. Implement Form Validation and State Management [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Add comprehensive validation to the colony creation form and implement proper state management for all form fields.
### Details:
Enhance the ColonyCreationForm component with validation rules: colony name must be 3-20 characters, attribute points must have a combined maximum (e.g., 20 total points to distribute), and all fields must be completed before submission. Create a custom useColonyForm hook to manage form state and validation logic. Implement visual feedback for validation errors using styled components or CSS modules. Add a progress indicator showing completion status of each section. Ensure form state persists if user navigates between steps.

## 3. Design UI with Animations and Responsive Layout [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Style the colony creation form with the specified naturalistic color palette and implement animations for transitions between steps.
### Details:
Create a ColonyCreation.module.css file with a color scheme using earthy tones (greens, browns, amber). Implement responsive layouts using CSS Grid and/or Flexbox that work well on both desktop and mobile devices (minimum support for 320px width). Add smooth transitions between form steps using CSS transitions or React animation libraries (like Framer Motion). Design custom UI elements for sliders and selection components that match the game's natural theme. Implement loading states and transitions for form submission.

## 4. Connect Form to Backend API [done]
### Dependencies: 3.2
### Description: Create API service and connect the colony creation form to the backend endpoints for saving colony data.
### Details:
Create a colonyService.js file in the src/services directory with functions to handle API communication. Implement a createColony function that sends POST requests to the /api/colonies endpoint with the form data. Add proper error handling for network failures and server errors. Implement loading states during API calls. Create a Redux slice (or context) to manage colony creation state globally if needed. Update the form submission handler to use this service and handle the response appropriately, including success and error states.

## 5. Implement Colony Preview and Confirmation Screen [done]
### Dependencies: 3.3, 3.4
### Description: Create a visual preview of the colony based on selected attributes and a confirmation screen before final submission.
### Details:
Create a ColonyPreview.jsx component that visualizes the colony based on selected attributes and colors. The preview should update in real-time as users adjust attributes. Implement a final confirmation screen as the last step in the form process, showing a summary of all selections. Add the ability to go back and edit any section from the confirmation screen. Create visual representations of how attribute selections might affect gameplay (e.g., strength visualization, speed indicators). Implement a success screen after successful colony creation with an option to start playing or view colony details.
