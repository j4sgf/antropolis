# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Repository and Development Environment
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project repository with React.js frontend and Node.js/Express backend structure. Configure Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion libraries.
# Details:
1. Create a monorepo structure with separate folders for frontend and backend
2. Initialize React app using create-react-app or Vite
3. Set up Express.js server with basic routing
4. Configure Tailwind CSS in the frontend
5. Install and configure Framer Motion for animations
6. Set up ESLint and Prettier for code quality
7. Create basic CI/CD pipeline for deployment to Vercel/Netlify (frontend) and Railway/Render (backend)
8. Configure environment variables for development and production

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the development environment runs without errors. Test the connection between frontend and backend with a simple API endpoint. Ensure Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion are working correctly by creating test components.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize Monorepo Structure and Git Repository [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the project's monorepo structure with separate directories for frontend and backend. Initialize Git repository with appropriate .gitignore file and README documentation.
### Details:
Create root directory with frontend/ and backend/ subdirectories. Initialize Git repository with appropriate .gitignore for Node.js projects. Create package.json at root level with workspace configuration. Document project structure and setup instructions in README.md. Set up conventional commit standards and branch protection rules.

## 2. Configure Frontend React Application with Tailwind CSS [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Initialize React application in the frontend directory using Vite. Configure Tailwind CSS for styling and set up the basic application structure.
### Details:
Run 'npm create vite@latest frontend -- --template react-ts' for TypeScript support. Install and configure Tailwind CSS following official documentation. Create basic folder structure (components/, pages/, hooks/, utils/, assets/). Set up index.html with appropriate meta tags and favicon. Configure absolute imports in tsconfig.json. Create basic App component and routing structure.

## 3. Set Up Express.js Backend with Basic Structure [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Initialize Node.js/Express.js application in the backend directory. Set up the server with basic middleware, error handling, and folder structure.
### Details:
Initialize package.json with 'npm init -y'. Install Express.js, cors, helmet, and other essential middleware. Create server.js as entry point. Set up middleware for parsing JSON, CORS, and security headers. Implement basic error handling middleware. Create routes/, controllers/, models/, and config/ directories. Implement a health check endpoint at GET /api/health. Configure dotenv for environment variables.

## 4. Implement Animation Framework with Framer Motion [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Install and configure Framer Motion in the frontend. Create reusable animation components and hooks for consistent animations throughout the application.
### Details:
Install Framer Motion with 'npm install framer-motion'. Create components/animations/ directory for reusable animation components. Implement common animation variants (fade, slide, scale). Create custom hooks for animation control (useAnimationControls). Set up animation context provider for global animation settings. Create documentation for animation usage patterns.

## 5. Configure Development Tools and CI/CD Pipeline [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2, 1.3
### Description: Set up ESLint and Prettier for code quality. Configure CI/CD pipeline for deployment to Vercel/Netlify (frontend) and Railway/Render (backend).
### Details:
Install and configure ESLint and Prettier in both frontend and backend. Create .eslintrc and .prettierrc files with appropriate rules. Set up husky for pre-commit hooks to enforce linting and formatting. Create GitHub Actions workflow files for CI/CD. Configure Vercel/Netlify for frontend deployment. Set up Railway/Render for backend deployment. Create environment variable templates (.env.example) for both frontend and backend. Document deployment process in README.md.
