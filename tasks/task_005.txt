# Task ID: 5
# Title: Ant Lifecycle System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the ant lifecycle simulation from egg to adult as specified in section 5.2.
# Details:
1. Create data models for each lifecycle stage: Egg, Larva, Pupa, Adult
2. Implement time-based progression through lifecycle stages
3. Design resource requirements for each stage (food consumption)
4. Create visual representations for each lifecycle stage
5. Implement colony population management:
   - Birth rate calculations based on resources
   - Death mechanics (age, battle, starvation)
6. Add lifecycle events that trigger at stage transitions
7. Implement queen ant mechanics for egg production
8. Balance lifecycle timing for engaging gameplay

# Test Strategy:
Test progression through all lifecycle stages. Verify resource consumption at each stage. Test population growth under various resource conditions. Verify death mechanics function correctly. Test edge cases like resource scarcity.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Ant Lifecycle Data Models [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement data models for each lifecycle stage (Egg, Larva, Pupa, Adult) with appropriate properties and state transitions.
### Details:
Create a base AntEntity class with common properties (id, age, stage, health) and stage-specific classes that extend it. Each class should include properties for: timeInStage, foodConsumption, nextStageThreshold, and visual representation ID. Implement database schema with appropriate tables and relationships. Create API endpoints for CRUD operations on ant entities.

## 2. Implement Lifecycle Progression System [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Create a time-based system that handles ant progression through lifecycle stages based on age, resources, and colony conditions.
### Details:
Implement a LifecycleManager service that runs on a game tick interval. For each ant, calculate age progression, check stage transition conditions, and handle stage transitions. Create transition functions between stages with appropriate validation. Implement resource consumption tracking during each stage. Add lifecycle events that trigger at stage transitions (using an event system).

## 3. Develop Queen Ant and Reproduction Mechanics [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2
### Description: Implement specialized queen ant functionality for egg production and colony growth management.
### Details:
Create a QueenAnt class extending the Adult ant type with special properties (eggProductionRate, fertilityLevel). Implement egg-laying mechanics based on colony resources and queen health. Add colony-level birth rate calculations based on available resources. Create API endpoints for queen status and egg production management. Implement frontend components to display queen status and egg production statistics.

## 4. Create Visual Representations for Lifecycle Stages [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Design and implement visual assets and rendering components for each ant lifecycle stage.
### Details:
Create sprite sheets or 3D models for each lifecycle stage with appropriate animations. Implement React components for rendering each lifecycle stage with proper scaling and positioning. Add visual effects for stage transitions. Create a LifecycleVisualController that maps ant entity data to the correct visual representation. Implement zoom levels to properly display different sized lifecycle stages.

## 5. Implement Colony Population Management [done]
### Dependencies: 5.2, 5.3
### Description: Create systems for managing ant population including death mechanics, resource balancing, and lifecycle timing.
### Details:
Implement death mechanics for ants based on age, battle damage, and starvation. Create a resource management system that tracks food consumption across all lifecycle stages. Balance lifecycle timing parameters for engaging gameplay (stored in configuration). Add colony-level statistics tracking for population by stage. Implement UI components to display population statistics and resource consumption. Create admin tools for adjusting lifecycle parameters during development.
