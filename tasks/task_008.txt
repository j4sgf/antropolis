# Task ID: 8
# Title: Procedural Map Generation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the procedural generation of tile-based maps as specified in section 5.6.
# Details:
1. Design tile-based map system with various terrain types
2. Implement procedural generation algorithm:
   - Perlin noise for natural terrain distribution
   - Placement of food sources, obstacles, and enemy colonies
   - Balancing resource distribution
3. Create map data structure for efficient storage and access
4. Implement map boundaries and size constraints
5. Add environmental features (water bodies, rocks, plants)
6. Create seed-based generation for reproducible maps
7. Optimize generation for performance
8. Implement difficulty scaling in map generation

# Test Strategy:
Test map generation with various seeds. Verify terrain distribution is natural and balanced. Test resource placement algorithms. Measure performance of map generation. Verify that maps scale appropriately with difficulty settings.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Tile System and Map Data Structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the foundational tile system and map data structure that will store the procedurally generated map data.
### Details:
1. Define a Tile class with properties for terrain type, resources, obstacles, and entities.
2. Create a MapGrid class that manages a 2D array of tiles with methods for accessing and modifying tiles.
3. Implement terrain type enums (GRASS, SAND, WATER, ROCK, etc.).
4. Add methods for efficient spatial queries (getNeighbors, getTilesInRadius).
5. Create serialization/deserialization methods for saving/loading maps.
6. Implement map boundary handling with configurable size constraints.

## 2. Implement Perlin Noise Generator for Terrain Distribution [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Create a Perlin noise generator to produce natural-looking terrain distributions across the map.
### Details:
1. Implement or integrate a Perlin noise library (consider simplex-noise.js).
2. Create a TerrainGenerator class that uses Perlin noise to assign terrain types to tiles.
3. Add configuration parameters for noise scale, octaves, persistence, and lacunarity.
4. Implement methods to map noise values to different terrain types using thresholds.
5. Add terrain transition smoothing to avoid unnatural boundaries between terrain types.
6. Create a visualization helper for debugging terrain generation.

## 3. Implement Resource and Feature Placement [done]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Add logic to place resources, obstacles, and environmental features on the generated terrain.
### Details:
1. Create a FeaturePlacer class responsible for distributing resources and features.
2. Implement algorithms for placing food sources with appropriate density based on terrain type.
3. Add obstacle generation (rocks, plants) with configurable density.
4. Implement water body generation (lakes, rivers) using noise and flood fill algorithms.
5. Create enemy colony placement logic that considers distance from player start position.
6. Add resource balancing logic to ensure fair distribution across the map.
7. Implement methods to prevent feature overlap and maintain playability.

## 4. Implement Seed-Based Generation System [done]
### Dependencies: 8.2, 8.3
### Description: Create a system for seed-based map generation to allow reproducible maps.
### Details:
1. Implement a seeded random number generator class.
2. Modify the terrain and feature generators to use the seeded RNG.
3. Create a MapGenerator class that orchestrates the entire generation process using a seed.
4. Add methods to extract the current seed from a generated map.
5. Implement seed validation and normalization.
6. Create a user interface component for entering custom seeds.
7. Add seed display and sharing functionality.

## 5. Implement Difficulty Scaling and Performance Optimization [done]
### Dependencies: 8.4
### Description: Add difficulty scaling to map generation and optimize the generation process for performance.
### Details:
1. Create a DifficultyManager class with presets (EASY, MEDIUM, HARD).
2. Implement difficulty-based adjustments for resource abundance, enemy colony placement, and obstacle density.
3. Add progressive difficulty scaling for campaign mode maps.
4. Optimize map generation using web workers for multi-threading.
5. Implement chunked generation for large maps to prevent UI freezing.
6. Add caching mechanisms for frequently accessed map data.
7. Create a loading indicator and progress tracking for map generation.
8. Implement map generation cancellation functionality.
