# Task ID: 16
# Title: Save and Load System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a save/load system for game progress as described in ST-109.
# Details:
1. Design save data structure capturing all relevant game state
2. Implement browser local storage save mechanism
3. Create optional cloud save functionality using Supabase or Firebase
4. Implement auto-save at regular intervals
5. Design save/load UI with save slots
6. Add save metadata (timestamp, colony stats summary)
7. Implement save data validation and error recovery
8. Create export/import functionality for save data

# Test Strategy:
Test saving and loading game state preserves all relevant data. Verify auto-save functions at specified intervals. Test cloud save synchronization. Verify save metadata is accurate. Test error recovery from corrupted save data. Test export/import functionality.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Save Data Structure and Local Storage Implementation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a comprehensive save data structure that captures all game state and implement the local storage save mechanism.
### Details:
1. Define a SaveGame interface in src/types/saveGame.ts that includes all necessary game state (colony resources, buildings, research, etc.)
2. Create a SaveManager class in src/utils/saveManager.ts with methods for serializing and deserializing game state
3. Implement localStorage.setItem() and localStorage.getItem() methods to save and retrieve game data
4. Add data compression using a library like lz-string to reduce storage size
5. Include version information in save data for future compatibility

## 2. Implement Save/Load UI with Save Slots [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a user interface for managing save games with multiple save slots, timestamps, and colony information.
### Details:
1. Create SaveGameModal component in src/components/SaveGame/
2. Design UI with a grid of save slots (at least 5) showing thumbnails and metadata
3. Implement manual save functionality with custom save names
4. Add confirmation dialogs for overwriting saves
5. Display save metadata including timestamp, colony name, population, and key resources
6. Style the UI to match the game's aesthetic

## 3. Implement Auto-Save and Save Data Validation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add automatic saving at regular intervals and implement validation to ensure save data integrity.
### Details:
1. Create an AutoSave class in src/utils/autoSave.ts that triggers saves at configurable intervals
2. Implement save triggers for important game events (end of day cycle, major construction, etc.)
3. Add save data validation schema using a library like Zod or Joi
4. Create error recovery mechanisms for corrupted saves
5. Implement a backup system that keeps the previous save until a new one is successfully created

## 4. Develop Cloud Save Functionality [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement cloud save functionality using Supabase to allow players to access their saves across devices.
### Details:
1. Set up Supabase tables for storing save data with appropriate columns (user_id, save_name, save_data, timestamp)
2. Create CloudSaveService in src/services/cloudSave.ts with methods for uploading and downloading saves
3. Implement user authentication flow for cloud saves
4. Add synchronization between local and cloud saves with conflict resolution
5. Implement bandwidth-efficient delta updates when possible
6. Add error handling for network issues and storage limits

## 5. Create Export/Import Functionality for Save Data [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the ability to export saves as files and import them, allowing players to backup their progress or share colonies.
### Details:
1. Create ExportImportService in src/services/exportImport.ts
2. Implement save export as JSON files with optional encryption
3. Add file import functionality with validation and error handling
4. Create UI components for the export/import process in src/components/SaveGame/ExportImport/
5. Add compatibility checks for imported saves from different game versions
6. Implement save conversion for backwards compatibility when possible
